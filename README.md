## Setup
1. Download the project repo, IDE, and server software.
2. Place the *laundryInterface* folder in the *htdocs* directory of your server installation. When you are running your server, the web interface can be accessed from your browser by typing *localhost* in the address bar.
3. Edit the following files to reflect your phone number:
	* *htdocs/laundryInterface/php/scripts/textDryerDone.sh*
	* *htdocs/laundryInterface/php/scripts/textWasherDone.sh*
4. Place the *micRead* and *laundryNotify* folders in your Arduino *Sketchbook* folder.
5. Assemble the circuit according to *wiringDiagram.png* in the *micRead* folder.
6. Run the *micRead.ino* sketch to verify connections. Use this sketch to take acoustic readings of your washer/dryer machines in order to determine sound thresholds used in the main *laundryNotify.ino* sketch.
7. Edit *laundryNotify.ino* to reflect the following:
	* WLAN_SSID, WLAN_PASS, WLAN_SECURITY
	* Server IP address
	* Sound thresholds
8. Everything should be ready to go â€” upload the *laundryNotify.ino* sketch to the Uno + CC3000 and open the serial monitor to check if it connects to the network/server.
9. Go to the web interface and select which machine is running and then set the notifier:
